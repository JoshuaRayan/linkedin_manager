This was a simple project for a quick idea I had. Linked being a hard app to navigate and track I created this project to see if there was a way to make it easier to do so.

Some improvements are needed on the frontend but I decided to not persue making an MVP out of this idea was because of the linkedins new scrapping policies which was one of the main feautres I wanted to add

Nevertheless I made a dashboard to track messages and recruiters.

It can be accessed on the frontend url, which I have deployed on vercel
